Production ready boilerplate with Webpack & Babel pre-configured.

Being a React JS developer is not a easy job. While working on React projects we need to do a lot of small configurations, we need to configure webpack and babel to get our code running.

Well you are thinking that facebook has already provided a package using which we can start working on React projects easily without any configurations. Check out [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

Yes, right you can start your project by using a single command 
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
But, using facebook `create-react-app` package will not provide you to customize the behavior of your React JS project. If you want customization and ability to use any plugins of your choice you need to setup the webpack and babel manually. 

Here, I have created a Boilerplate which can be used for starting your React or Node projects asap, also you can add/remove packages, plugins of your choice.
